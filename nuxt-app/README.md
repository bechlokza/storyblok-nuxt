Look at the [nuxt 3 documentation](https://v3.nuxtjs.org) to learn more.

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# yarn
yarn install

# npm
npm install

# pnpm
pnpm install --shamefully-hoist
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on http://localhost:3000

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
npm run preview

During development, apps are usually served via HTTP. However, Storyblok v2 requires your app to be served via HTTPS. Please follow the steps below to enable this in a Nuxt 3 project.

Install mkcert on your system The installation instructions for macOS, Windows and Linux can be found in the mkcert Github repository.

Create a valid certificate by running the following command in your project folder:
mkcert localhost

In the projectâ€™s package.json, change the nuxt dev command to the following:
nuxt dev --https --ssl-cert localhost.pem --ssl-key localhost-key.pem

Run your project using npm run dev. Your project will now be served on https://localhost:3000.

Checkout the [deployment documentation](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/deploy/presets) for more information.
